			<h3>Business Savvy, Technology Literate</h3>
			<p>I am a young energetic soul with strong passions for business and the Internet. I love what can happen when the two interact with each other.
      </p>

      <p>I have always been drawn to the business world. Working my first job at 11 years old I have predominately been on the employee end of business. Aspiring to management/owner positions I have tried to gain as much experience as I can before progressing to the next stage. My exposure includes: finance, accounting, marketing, project management and IT.     
      </p>

      <p>The Internet and tech sector have undoubtedly become important parts of the world. Their magnitude, rate-of-change and entrepreneurial spirit all very much appeal to me. My fascination grew out of control resulting in me taking action. Enter HackerYou, an incredible organization designed to teach and enable willing individuals to become front-end web developers. For me, this is the starting point of a bigger journey. I plan on venturing deep into web technology armed with tools from HackerYou.
      </p>

      <p>My ultimate goal is to marry my passions for business and technology. In doing so I hope to create spectacular things improving the lives of many.

			<h3>Learn</h3>
			<p>I believe in brain plasticity, and I also believe in keeping it as high as possible. As disciplines advance forward they require regular upgrading of skill-sets to stay on top. None demand more than the web itself. I am drawn to the web because it's high rate-of-change demands constant adaptability and openness to radical new ideas.</p>

			<h3>Experiment</h3>
			<p>I love experimenting. Take something, change it, see what happens and repeat. The Internet age has taken this to a whole new level. With the right set of knowledge and tools one can literally experiment with anything on the web.  </p>

			<h3>Have Fun</h3>
			<p>Astronomy has humbled me with both time and space. Our lives are truly a blink of an eye, lived out on the tiniest of pebbles in the biggest of oceans. It is for these reasons that I cannot take life too seriously nor live it without thoroughly enjoying myself.</p>
